# Ping-Pong-JS-project
<h1> Description </h1>
<p> This project is a very simple game called Ping Pong. I have used Canvas. Canvas is an element that is used to draw graphics on a webpage. Canvas is just a container for graphics. I have used JavaScript to draw graphics on it. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images. There is a function named animate to animate and make movement smooth on canvas. Using animate pedals of the pong and movement is controlled. It's a one-player game. Pedals of the player move with mouse movement. The maximum score to win is 7. This project was chosen to understand the use of canvas and how to make graphics and animate using JavaScript. I have used JS and a little bit of JS to give color and texture to my graphics.</p>
